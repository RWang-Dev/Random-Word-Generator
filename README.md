# Random-Word-Generator
AKA Gibberisher
This program is built and run directly in Visual Studio Code. 
The program takes a full dictionary of any English like/alphabet present languages, 
sorts through the data, trains the program on the grammar rules, 
and returns gibberish words that perfectly follows said phonetic rules of that language.

Feel free to download and test it out by running the GibberisherMain class. 
Experiment by changing the values of the section lengths and word counts to create more interesting words
